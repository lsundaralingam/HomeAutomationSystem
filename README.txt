Home Automation System

	The objective of this project is to implement a miniature Home Automation System (HAS). After reading and recognizing the signal from a RFID chip, our webserver will activate the stored HAS settings customized by the user on our web page. The Wi-Fi module will then retrieve and send the automation data from the server to the Arduino circuit and trigger the desired settings. In short, a user would be able to control his houseâ€™s lights and door locks on our web page using their unique RFID. 
The motivation behind this lab is to practice client-server communication, work with the presentation and data access networking layers, as well as to advance our knowledge on Arduino, wireless modules and physical computing.
